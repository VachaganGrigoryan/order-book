# Stock Service

The Stock Service is a web application built using Django REST for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. It offers essential features such as user registration, login, and an order book functionality with transaction history. Users must log in to access the service, where they can view and manage their own orders and transaction history. The application supports the creation of new BUY or SELL orders.
